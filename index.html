            <li>
              <strong>1905</strong>- Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.

            <p>“So Einstein was wrong when he said, "God does not play dice." Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen.”
